# Amazon Clone

A work-in-progress. I'm creating an amazon clone to learn TypeScript, Nest.js, Docker, Redux, and improve my skills in React, APIs, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

This project is based on [Jon-Peppinck's amazon-clone tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCNAqAgSL_4&list=PL9_OU-1M9E_sGc8wmVspxGwHUdCqDV8pM).
